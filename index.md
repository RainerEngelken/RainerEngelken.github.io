# Dynamics and learning in neural networks, from single neurons to large scale circuits

I am **Rainer Engelken**, an **Incoming Assistant Professor at UIUC ECE**. I work at the interface of **dynamical systems**, **computational neuroscience**, and **machine learning**. I study how coordinated interactions of neurons give rise to complex dynamics and computation in biological and artificial neural networks, and how learning unfolds over time.

**Focus areas**
- **Learning Dynamics:** activities, synapses, and representations evolving during learning; links between stability and temporal credit assignment.
- **Chaos and Stability:** full Lyapunov spectra in RNNs; sparse chaos in spiking circuits; controllability and entropy rates.
- **Spiking Networks and Efficient Algorithms:** event based simulation and training of large SNNs (SparseProp); scaling laws.
- **Neural Manifolds and Replay:** low dimensional structure in hippocampal population activity; manifold consistency across trials and days; sequential ITI events.
