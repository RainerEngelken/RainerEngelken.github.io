### Fall 2025: ECE 598 RE - Dynamical Systems and Neural Networks

This graduate-level course explores the deep interplay between dynamical systems theory and neural networks. We move beyond treating neural networks as "black boxes" to understand *why* they work, using the tools of chaos, stability, and attractor dynamics. The course emphasizes hands-on computational analysis to build a strong theoretical and intuitive understanding of learning 
and computation in brains and machines.

#### Course Description
In this course, we will analyze how stability, attractors, bifurcations, and chaos govern the behavior and learning capabilities of neural networks. The course covers foundational discrete and continuous-time dynamical systems, applying them to the analysis of modern machine learning models (including training dynamics) and complex neural circuits (both rate-based and spiking). The course culminates in a research project applying these interdisciplinary concepts.

#### Prerequisites
- **Required:** Multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and basic proficiency in Python or Julia.
- **Recommended:** Familiarity with ordinary differential equations and foundational machine learning concepts.
