# Dynamics & learning in neural networks — from single neurons to large-scale circuits

I'm **Rainer Engelken**, an **Incoming Assistant Professor at UIUC ECE**. I work at the interface of **dynamical systems**, **computational neuroscience**, and **machine learning**. I study how coordinated interactions of neurons give rise to complex dynamics and computation in **biological** and **artificial** neural networks — and how learning unfolds over time.

**Focus areas**
- **Learning Dynamics:** activities, synapses, and representations evolving over learning; links between stability and temporal credit assignment.
- **Chaos & Stability:** full Lyapunov spectra in RNNs; *sparse chaos* in spiking circuits; controllability and entropy rates.
- **Spiking Networks & Efficient Algorithms:** event-based simulation/training of large SNNs (*SparseProp*); scaling laws.
- **Neural Manifolds & Replay:** low-dimensional structure in hippocampal population activity; manifold consistency across trials/days; sequential ITI events.
